Medical Knowledge Search Query Optimization

User Query: {query}
Knowledge Type Filter: {knowledge_type}
Search Limit: {limit}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the user's medical query intent
2. Extract key medical concepts and terminology
3. Generate embeddings that capture:
   - Primary medical concepts
   - Related symptoms or conditions
   - Treatment modalities
   - Diagnostic criteria
4. Perform similarity search in the knowledge graph
5. Rank results by relevance and confidence score

Expected Output:
- List of medical knowledge nodes
- Relevance scores
- Knowledge types (disease, symptom, treatment, etc.)
- Associated properties and metadata

Search Strategy:
- Semantic similarity matching
- Medical ontology awareness
- Context-aware ranking
