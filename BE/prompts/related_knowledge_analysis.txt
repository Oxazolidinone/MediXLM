Related Medical Knowledge Analysis

Root Node: {node_name} (ID: {node_id})
Relationship Filter: {relationship_type}
Traversal Depth: {depth}

Analysis Instructions:
1. Traverse the knowledge graph from the root node
2. Follow relationships up to specified depth
3. Apply relationship type filter if specified
4. Collect related medical knowledge nodes

Relationship Traversal Strategy:
- Depth 1: Direct relationships only
- Depth 2: Include secondary connections
- Depth 3+: Extended medical context

Analysis Focus:
1. Clinical Pathways
   - Diagnostic sequences
   - Treatment protocols
   - Symptom progressions

2. Knowledge Clusters
   - Related diseases
   - Treatment alternatives
   - Differential diagnoses

3. Contraindications
   - Conflicting treatments
   - Risk factors
   - Patient safety concerns

Output Format:
For each related node:
- Knowledge ID and name
- Knowledge type
- Relationship path from root
- Relationship strength
- Clinical relevance
- Confidence score

Prioritization:
- Rank by clinical importance
- Consider evidence level
- Factor in relationship strength
